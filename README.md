# opensource contributions
List of opensource contributions done by me.

Contributed to bunjs where I was able to add some jest-extended matchers into bun’s testing ecosystem by adding C++ bindings to JavaScript engine’s Object.values() method and do rest of the implementation in ziglang and my Pull Request got merged into bun codebase.

Contributed to Project ZVM, a version management tool for ziglang written in Golang. I succeeded in adding a new feature that will allow windows user to run ZVM commands without explicitly running terminal in administrative. This will automatically ask to elevate permission when needed.
